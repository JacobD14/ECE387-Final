Perfect Push Up - 
Written Proposal

# Objective
  The objective of this project is to help people with their technique when doing push-ups in the weight room using a muscle sensor.
  
# Features
  The muscle sensor will detect when the person is down in the push-up and start a timer for about a second. A buzzer will then go off signaling for the person to "push up." A counter keeps track of how many push ups are completed. When the sensor doesn't detect any more push-ups being done, it will end the program. To make this into a type of game for motivation, using some Python code, the results from the session will be automatically tweeted out, challenging the person's followers to try and beat him.
